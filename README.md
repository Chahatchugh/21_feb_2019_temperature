 a code with these methods:
   insert() - records a new temperature

   get_max() - returns the highest temp we've seen so far

   get_min() - returns the lowest temp we've seen so far

   get_mean() - returns the mean of all temps we've seen so far

   get_mode() - returns a mode of all temps we've seen so far

get_mean() return a float, but the rest of the getter methods can return integers. Temperatures will all be inserted as integers and we can assume they will be in the range 0 ℃ to 150 ℃.
